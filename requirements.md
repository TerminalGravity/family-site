Below is a high-level technical specification for a family dinner scheduling and engagement website built with **Nuxt** and **Bun** as the runtime. This specification assumes familiarity with modern web development best practices and a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript environment.

---

### Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Create a private, family-focused website to manage a year-long weekly dinner rotation among three households. The site will include a calendar view, meal planning, game recommendations, a photo gallery, reminders, and interactive features (comments, polls).

**Key Features:**  
1. **Home Page/Dashboard:** Overview of the current week’s dinner host, upcoming meals, and quick links to other sections.
2. **Interactive Calendar:** A year-long schedule with a 3-host rotation. Hover or click on a date to view details about the meal theme and game choice.
3. **Meal & Game Library:** A searchable list of family-favorite recipes and game instructions.
4. **Media Gallery:** A private gallery of photos from past dinners.
5. **User Interactions:** Private comment threads or polls for each scheduled dinner.
6. **Private Access:** A password-protected portal or simple authentication mechanism to keep content private.
7. **Automated Notifications:** Optional email reminders for upcoming dinners using a server-side scheduled task.
8. **Responsive Design:** Full mobile responsiveness and compatibility with various screen sizes.
9. **Performance & Security:** Fast load times and secure data handling.

### Technical Stack

**Frontend Framework:**  
- **Nuxt 3** (latest stable version)  
  - Leverages Vue 3 and Composition API for building reactive and modular components.
  - Built-in file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) options.
  - Nuxt’s Nitro engine allows flexibility in deploying to various runtimes, including Bun.

**Runtime & Package Manager:**  
- **Bun** as the runtime and package manager.  
  - Faster startup and execution times compared to Node.js.
  - Native TypeScript support and built-in bundler reduce complexity and improve performance.
  
**Styling & UI:**  
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, utility-first styling.  
- **Nuxt Components & Nuxt Image** for optimized images and component-based design.
- **Icon Library** (e.g., Heroicons) for consistent iconography.

**Data & State Management:**  
- **Pinia** for lightweight state management within Nuxt.  
- **Local Storage** or cookies for simple user preferences (e.g., dark mode, last visited page).

**Authentication & Authorization:**  
- Simple password-protected access. Since this is a private family site, consider a single shared passphrase or a minimal user account system with a JSON file or SQLite database.
- Utilize Nuxt’s server routes (`/server/api`) for authentication logic.
- Store hashed passwords and handle session tokens securely.

**Data Storage & CMS:**  
- **Lightweight Database:** SQLite or a local JSON file-based store (versioned with Git or on the server’s filesystem) for simplicity and minimal hosting overhead.
- Content (meal plans, schedules, recipes, game rules) can be stored as markdown or YAML files and fetched at build time or dynamically in server routes.
- Photos can be stored locally on the server or on a private storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3) and served via the Nuxt Image module for optimization.

**Email & Notifications:**  
- **Server-side Scripting with Nitro:** Use server routes or scheduled functions to send weekly reminders via a transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark, or AWS SES).
- **Cron-like Scheduling:** Leverage Bun’s scheduler or a third-party service (e.g., GitHub Actions, CRON job on the server) to trigger weekly email reminders.

**Deployment & Hosting:**  
- Deploy on a platform that supports Bun and Nuxt easily (e.g., a Bun-compatible server, DigitalOcean Droplet, or a self-hosted environment).
- Use Nitro’s server output and run via Bun `bun run` commands.
- SSL/TLS using a service like Let’s Encrypt or a managed SSL certificate from the hosting provider.

**Performance & Caching:**  
- SSR/SSG for quick initial loads.
- Nuxt Image for automatic image optimization and lazy loading.
- HTTP caching headers set for static assets.
- Pre-fetching of data for upcoming weeks if implementing SSG or dynamic routes.

### Site Structure & Navigation

**Suggested Routes:**
- `/` (Home/Dashboard): Displays the current week’s dinner info, next week’s host, quick links.
- `/calendar`: An interactive view of all 52 weeks with color-coded hosts.
- `/meal-library`: Searchable recipes and meal ideas.
- `/game-library`: List of recommended games with short how-to guides.
- `/photos`: A private gallery sorted by date (requires auth).
- `/login`: Simple login screen (if implementing per-user auth).
- `/admin` (optional): For adding/editing future dinners, recipes, and managing photos.
  
**Dynamic Pages:**
- `/week/[id]`: Detailed page for a specific week’s dinner, host, menu, game, and comment thread.
- `/recipe/[slug]`: Detailed recipe pages.
- `/game/[slug]`: Detailed game instructions.

---

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup Nuxt & Bun:**
   - Initialize Nuxt 3 project: `npx nuxi init`
   - Integrate Bun: run `bun install` and adapt scripts accordingly.
   - Configure Nuxt config for SSR and Tailwind CSS integration.

2. **Component Development:**
   - Build UI components (e.g., CalendarCell, MealCard, GameCard, PhotoGallery).
   - Ensure atomic design principles: small reusable UI elements.

3. **Data Layer:**
   - Setup server-side API endpoints using `/server/api/` routes.
   - Create endpoints for:
     - `GET /api/weeks` to fetch all schedule data.
     - `GET /api/recipes` & `GET /api/games` for library content.
     - `POST /api/comments` for family members to leave notes.
   
4. **Authentication:**
   - Implement a simple session check in server middleware.
   - Store a hashed password in environment variables or a small config file.
   - Use a login form that sets a secure cookie on success.

5. **Styling & Theming:**
   - Tailwind CSS configuration for a consistent family brand (colors, fonts).
   - Light/dark mode toggle stored in local state.

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
   - Unit tests for components using `vitest` or `jest`.
   - Integration tests for basic routes and API endpoints.
   - Manual testing on multiple devices and browsers.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Build the app using `nuxt build` and run the server using Bun: `bun run start`.
   - Ensure environment variables for production are set (e.g., password, email API keys).
   - Set up a domain and HTTPS.

### Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- **Easy Content Editing:**  
  Future possibility of integrating a headless CMS (e.g., Contentful) if non-technical family members want to update menus or add recipes easily.

- **Scaling:**  
  The site is family-focused and unlikely to need high scalability, but SSR and caching make it performant even on low-tier hosting.

- **Feature Additions:**
  - Polls and voting on next week’s cuisine.
  - Private messaging for updates.
  - Push notifications (if supported by user devices).
